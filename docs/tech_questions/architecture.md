#### What components or methods have you used to improve website performance, usability and concurrency
- Improve hardware capabilities and increase system servers. (When the server increases to a certain extent, the concurrent access that the system can provide is almost unchanged, so the problem cannot be fundamentally solved)
- Use cache (local cache: JDK's own Map, Guava Cache. Distributed cache: Redis, Memcache. Local cache is not suitable for increasing the concurrency of the system, generally used in the program).
- Use Browser cache.
- CDN acceleration (cache some static resources such as pictures, videos, etc. to the network node closest to the user)
- Database Split (read-write separation), sub-table (horizontal sub-table, vertical sub-table)
- Use the appropriate connection pool (database connection pool, thread pool, etc.)
- Message queue (decoupling + peak clipping + asynchronous)
- Adopt a cluster (multiple machines provide the same service)
- Use distributed development - Use micro-service architecture. (different services are deployed on different machine nodes, and a service can also be deployed on multiple machines, and then use Nginx load balancing access. This solves the shortcomings of single point deployment (All In), greatly Increased system concurrency)

#### Common methods for designing high-availability systems
- Downgrading Service: Service downgrading refers to the strategic downgrading of some services and pages based on current business conditions and traffic when server pressure increases sharply, so as to release server resources to ensure the normal operation of core tasks. Downgrades often specify different levels and perform different treatments for different abnormal levels. According to the service method: the service can be rejected, the service can be delayed, and sometimes the service can be random. According to the scope of service: you can cut off a certain function, you can also cut off some modules. In short, service degradation requires different degradation strategies according to different business requirements. The main purpose is that although the service is damaged, it is better than nothing;
- Current limit: Prevent malicious request traffic, malicious attacks, or prevent traffic from exceeding the peak value of the system;
- Caching: Avoid a large number of requests from directly falling into the database, which will destroy the database;
- Timeout and retry mechanism: Avoid avalanche caused by request accumulation;
- Rollback mechanism: Quickly fix the wrong version.

#### What are the characteristics of modern Internet application systems?
- High concurrency and large traffic;
- High availability: system 7Ã—24 hours uninterrupted service;
- Mass data: need to store and manage mass data, and need to use a large number of servers;
- The users are widely distributed and the network situation is complicated: many large-scale Internet services provide services for users around the world, and the users are distributed in a wide range, and the network conditions in various regions are very different;
- Poor security environment: Due to the openness of the Internet, the Internet is more vulnerable to attacks, and large websites are attacked by hackers almost every day;
- Rapid changes in demand and frequent releases: Unlike the release frequency of traditional software versions, Internet products quickly adapt to the market and meet user needs, and their product release frequencies are extremely high;
- Progressive development: Unlike traditional software products or enterprise application systems that plan all functional and non-functional requirements from the beginning, almost all large-scale Internet websites start from a small website and develop gradually.
